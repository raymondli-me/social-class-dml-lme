Author: Social Class DML-LME Analysis Pipeline
Model: Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct

OBJECTIVE
---------
To evaluate how 50 different phrasings of social class measurement prompts affect LLM ratings 
of perceived social class in personal narrative essays.

RESEARCH QUESTIONS
------------------
1. Do different prompt phrasings yield consistent social class ratings?
2. Which prompt variations show highest correlation with human judgments?
3. What is the variance in ratings across different prompt formulations?
4. Are certain phrasings more sensitive to specific socioeconomic indicators?

DATA
----
- Test Sample: 10 essays from essay_dataset.csv (first 10 rows)
- Ground Truth: Human social class ratings (1-10 scale) in 'judgement' column
- Education Levels: Ranging from "Less than high school" to "Graduate"
- Prompts: 50 variations from ladder_variations_50_complete.csv

PROMPT CATEGORIES
-----------------
The 50 prompts include variations on:
1. Standard ladder metaphor (1-10 lowest to highest)
2. Status ratings (low to high)
3. Economic position (struggling to wealthy)
4. Social rank/order
5. Class standing
6. Privilege levels
7. Success measures
8. Power/influence ratings
9. Life outcomes
10. Social hierarchy placement

METHODOLOGY
-----------
1. Data Preparation:
   - Extract first 10 essays from dataset
   - Maintain essay ID, text, education level, and human judgment

2. LLM Processing:
   - Model: Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct
   - Temperature: 0.1 (for consistency)
   - Max tokens: 100
   - Batch size: 5
   - All 50 prompts applied to each essay

3. Output Format:
   - Each prompt generates a 1-10 rating
   - JSON response format: {"[metric_name]": [1-10]}
   - 10 essays × 50 prompts = 500 total ratings

4. Analysis Plan:
   - Calculate mean and variance for each essay across prompts
   - Compute correlation between each prompt and human judgment
   - Identify prompts with highest/lowest agreement
   - Analyze prompt sensitivity by education level
   - Create visualization of rating distributions

EXPECTED OUTPUTS
----------------
1. Raw ratings matrix (10 essays × 50 prompts)
2. Statistical summary (means, variances, correlations)
3. Visualization of rating distributions
4. Interpretation document with findings

HYPOTHESES
----------
H1: Economic-focused prompts will show higher variance than status-focused prompts
H2: Prompts using "ladder" metaphor will correlate most strongly with human judgments
H3: Essays from higher education levels will show less variance across prompt types
H4: Certain prompts will be more sensitive to specific text features
