### Explanation:
The life described seems to be moderately comfortable. The person is married with a child and has a stable routine, which suggests a certain level of stability and comfort. However, the daily chores and responsibilities, especially the housework, seem to be quite demanding and time-consuming.

Overall, a comfort level of 6 out of 10 seems appropriate given the balance of stability and the demanding nature of the daily tasks.
