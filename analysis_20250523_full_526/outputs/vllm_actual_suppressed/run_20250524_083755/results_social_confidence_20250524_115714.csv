The text provided gives some indication of the person's social activities and interactions. They mention playing table tennis at the town hall with a group of 10 people every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, which suggests a moderate level of social engagement and comfort in group settings.

Explanation: The person seems to be very introverted and focused on their work and personal interests, particularly animals and insects. They live far away from others to avoid disturbing them with the noise from their animals, which suggests they prefer solitude.

Explanation: The narrative suggests that the person is somewhat socially confident but also faces challenges and stress, particularly from balancing work and home life, and dealing with her husband's disapproval. The social confidence level of 5 reflects a moderate level of comfort in social situations, but with room for improvement and growth. The person is not entirely comfortable with her social roles, especially in balancing her professional and personal life, but she is not entirely lacking in confidence either. She has moments of happiness and pride, particularly regarding her teaching and her child, which contribute to her social confidence. However, the ongoing arguments and the stress of balancing multiple responsibilities indicate that her social confidence is not at a high level. Therefore, a middle value of 5 seems appropriate.
