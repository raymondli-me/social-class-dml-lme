- **Income**: £35 per week is a relatively modest income, but it's not specified if this is the total income or just a portion of it. Assuming this is the weekly income, it's not a high salary, but it's sufficient for basic needs.
- **Living Situation**: Living at home with parents likely reduces living expenses significantly.
- **Car Ownership**: Owning a Mercedes 280 suggests a certain level of disposable income.
- **Hobbies and Leisure**: Membership in a fishing club and a flying club, as well as regular dining out with parents, indicate some disposable income for leisure activities.
- **Vacation**: Taking three weeks of holiday and spending it in Majorca with parents suggests the ability to afford travel and leisure.
