# Mid-Run Checkpoint: vLLM Processing Results Assessment
**Time:** 2025-05-24 10:08:00  
**Progress:** 18/51 prompts completed (35%)  
**Status:** Running smoothly, GPUs stable at 71-81Â°C

## Results Quality Assessment

### Rating Distribution & Accuracy
- **Range utilization:** Model using full 1-10 scale appropriately (observed: 3-8)
- **Consistency:** Both JSON-formatted and free-text prompts producing valid responses
- **Reasoning quality:** Detailed explanations showing sophisticated understanding of social class indicators

### Key Observations
1. **Social class detection:** Model identifying wealth indicators (horses, international travel, multiple vehicles) and educational markers (grammar, spelling)
2. **Nuanced scoring:** Balancing multiple factors (e.g., rating 8 for wealthy family with grammatical errors)
3. **Context awareness:** Considering age-appropriate factors (disregarding youth spelling errors when other wealth indicators present)

### Sample Response Quality
- **Human MacArthur ladder:** "8 - family with significant resources, including a car, a horse, and international travel, but grammatical errors suggest not very top"
- **Power position:** Proper JSON format with detailed explanations of influence levels

### Technical Performance
- **Zero parsing failures** (vs 99.5% failure in initial attempts)
- **Complete responses** (200 max_tokens sufficient)
- **Processing rate:** ~2.8 prompts/hour on 526 essays

## Preliminary Assessment
Results suggest the model is successfully capturing social class gradations with appropriate reasoning. The combination of wealth indicators, educational markers, and lifestyle factors aligns with sociological understanding of social stratification.

**Next milestone:** Full 51-prompt completion expected ~16:00-18:00 today.
