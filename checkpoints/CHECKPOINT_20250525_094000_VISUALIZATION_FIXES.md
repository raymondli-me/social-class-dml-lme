# Checkpoint: AI Rating Visualization Fixes
**Date:** 2025-05-25 09:40:00
**Status:** Successfully fixed AI rating visualization with proper 1-10 scale and filters

## Summary
Fixed critical issues with the 3D UMAP visualization where AI ratings were not displaying correctly. The AI ratings are averaged from 2 prompts, resulting in values from 1.0 to 9.5 in 0.5 increments.

## Key Discoveries
1. **AI Ratings Range**: The ratings are 1-10 but averaged from 2 prompts, giving values like 3.5, 4.5, etc.
2. **Distribution**: Most essays cluster around 3-5 rating (mean: 4.39)
   - Only 2 essays rated 1.0
   - Only 1 essay rated 9.5
   - Peak values: 3.0 (2488 essays) and 5.0 (2322 essays)

## Files Created/Modified

### Scripts
- `/scripts/fix_ai_rating_colors.py` - First attempt to fix colors (had syntax errors)
- `/scripts/create_proper_ai_filters.py` - Second attempt with dynamic filters
- `/scripts/create_working_ai_filters.py` - Line-by-line modification approach
- `/scripts/debug_visualization.py` - Debug tool to test JavaScript loading
- `/scripts/add_ai_filters_minimal.py` - Final working solution

### Visualizations
- `/custom_visualizations/umap_ai_filters_final_20250525_093917.html` - **WORKING VERSION**
  - Full color spectrum: purple (1) → blue → green → yellow → red (10)
  - Dynamic filters: 1-9.5 for AI ratings, 1-5 for social class
  - Based on known working version with minimal changes

## Technical Issues Resolved
1. **Syntax Error**: Fixed unexpected token '}' errors from regex replacements
2. **Data Display**: Fixed issue where data was showing as text instead of being parsed
3. **Color Mapping**: Implemented proper 1-10 scale mapping for averaged values
4. **Dynamic Filters**: Created filters that adapt based on viewing mode

## Current State
- Working visualization with proper AI rating display (1-10 scale)
- Dynamic filters showing actual rating values (1, 1.5, 2, ..., 9.5)
- Full color spectrum properly mapped to rating values
- All interactive features preserved from working base

## Next Steps
- Could add more features like font size controls, pan mode, etc.
- Could create separate visualizations for different prompt types
- Could add statistical overlays showing rating distributions
