# Complete Session Summary - Social Class DML Analysis
**Date:** 2025-05-25  
**Final Status:** All analyses implemented and documented  
**Repository:** https://github.com/raymondli-me/social-class-dml-lme

## Project Overview

Using Large Language Models (LLMs) to measure social class from text essays, then applying Double Machine Learning (DML) to understand predictive patterns and prepare for causal inference.

## What Was Accomplished This Session

### 1. ✅ Full DML Analysis with Cross-Validation
- Implemented proper 5-fold cross-fitting for valid statistical inference
- Tested 4 ML methods: Linear, Lasso, Random Forest, XGBoost
- **Key finding:** AI ratings achieve R² = 0.870 with XGBoost (vs 0.761 for actual SC)
- Created optimized pipeline with batch processing and checkpointing

### 2. ✅ Distribution Analysis  
- Discovered severe range restriction in self-reported social class (75% rate as "3")
- AI ratings use full 1-10 scale with normal distribution
- Correlation between AI and actual SC: r = 0.25
- Generated comprehensive visualization (`ai_sc_distributions.png`)

### 3. ✅ Interactive UMAP Visualization (Ready to Run)
- Implemented 3D interactive visualization with Plotly
- Two versions: colored by actual SC (discrete) and AI ratings (continuous)
- Features: hover tooltips, click-to-expand essays, LIME explanations
- Uses XGBoost model for LIME feature importance

### 4. ✅ SHAP Analysis Implementation (Ready to Run)
- TreeSHAP for both Random Forest and XGBoost
- Comprehensive visualizations: summary plots, waterfall plots, dependence plots
- Feature importance comparison between models
- Full interpretability pipeline

## Key Scripts for Next Agent

### Ready to Execute

1. **UMAP Visualization** (30-45 min runtime):
```bash
cd "/media/raymondli/Crucial X9/2025_05_23_VLLM_IPAD_ANALYSES/2025_05_23_social_class_dml_lme"
python3 scripts/create_umap_visualization.py
```
Creates: `umap_actual_social_class.html`, `umap_ai_ratings.html`

2. **SHAP Analysis** (15-20 min runtime):
```bash
cd "/media/raymondli/Crucial X9/2025_05_23_VLLM_IPAD_ANALYSES/2025_05_23_social_class_dml_lme"
python3 scripts/compute_shap_analysis.py
```
Creates: Multiple PNG visualizations and CSV reports in `shap_results/`

### Completed Scripts

- `scripts/dml_social_class_analysis_optimized.py` - Full DML pipeline
- `scripts/plot_distributions.py` - Distribution comparisons
- `scripts/display_results_simple.py` - Results summary tables

## Key Results Summary

| Metric | Value | Significance |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| Best AI R² (XGBoost) | 0.870 | Excellent predictive power |
| Best SC R² (XGBoost) | 0.761 | Good but lower than AI |
| AI vs SC correlation | 0.25 | Moderate relationship |
| Inter-prompt agreement | 0.836 | High consistency |
| SC range used | 1-5 | Severe restriction |
| AI range used | 1-9.5 | Full scale utilization |

## Technical Environment

- **Python:** 3.10.12
- **Key packages:** All installed and tested
  - scikit-learn, xgboost, sentence-transformers
  - umap-learn, plotly, shap
  - pandas, numpy, matplotlib
- **GPU:** CUDA available (used for embeddings)
- **Data location:** External drive path hardcoded

## Pending Tasks

1. **Execute UMAP visualization** - Will create interactive HTML files
2. **Execute SHAP analysis** - Will generate interpretability reports
3. **Binary features processing** - 100 prompts for additional features
4. **DML-LME causal analysis** - Use results for education effect estimation
5. **Linguistic analysis** - Investigate what top PCs represent

## Future Considerations for Improved Analysis

### Alternative Embedding Approaches
The current analysis uses sentence embeddings from `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (384 dimensions). Consider exploring:

1. **Word-level embeddings instead of sentence-level:**
   - May capture more granular linguistic features
   - Could reveal specific vocabulary associated with social class
   - Options: Word2Vec, GloVe, or contextual word embeddings from BERT

2. **State-of-the-art embedding models:**
   - **OpenAI embeddings** (text-embedding-ada-002 or text-embedding-3-large)
     - Higher dimensional (1536 or 3072)
     - Trained on more diverse data
     - May capture subtler social class indicators
   - **Google's Gemini embeddings** (text-embedding-004)
     - 768 dimensions
     - Multilingual capabilities
     - Recent architecture improvements

3. **Re-run complete pipeline with new embeddings:**
   - Generate new embeddings → PCA → DML analysis
   - Compare R² scores across embedding types
   - May achieve even better than current 0.870 R²
   - Could provide different interpretability insights

### Implementation sketch:
```python
# Example with OpenAI embeddings
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

def get_openai_embeddings(texts, model="text-embedding-3-large"):
    embeddings = []
    for batch in tqdm(chunks(texts, 100)):
        response = client.embeddings.create(input=batch, model=model)
        embeddings.extend([e.embedding for e in response.data])
    return np.array(embeddings)

# Then: PCA → DML → UMAP → SHAP as before
```

This could be a valuable robustness check and potentially improve performance further.

## Important Notes for Next Agent

1. **All scripts use absolute paths** - Should work as-is
2. **Checkpointing implemented** - Scripts can resume if interrupted
3. **XGBoost is key model** - Used for both LIME and SHAP
4. **PCA components** - 100 components explaining 82.3% variance
5. **Full dataset processing** - No sampling, all 9,513 essays

## Final Status
Project is in excellent shape with comprehensive analyses implemented. The combination of DML, UMAP visualization, and SHAP interpretability provides a complete framework for understanding how AI measures social class from text. Next agent can execute the pending scripts and proceed with causal analysis.
