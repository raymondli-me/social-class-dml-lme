# UMAP Visualization v17 - Real-Time Interactive Thresholds

**Date:** 2025-05-27
**Status:** COMPLETE - Enhanced real-time interactivity

## Summary

Version 17 builds on v16's foundation by removing the "Apply Thresholds" button and making all threshold adjustments update in real-time. This creates a more fluid, responsive user experience.

## Key Improvements in v17

### 1. Real-Time Updates
- Removed "Apply Thresholds" button completely
- All slider movements immediately update the visualization
- Threshold value changes instantly reflect in dot colors
- Category counts update dynamically as you drag

### 2. Preset Buttons
- **Extremes (P10/P90)** - Default, highlights top/bottom 10%
- **Quartiles (P25/P75)** - Shows top/bottom 25% 
- **Median (P50)** - Shows only exact median values
- Vertically stacked for clean UI design

### 3. Enhanced Slider Behavior
- Changed from `onchange` to `oninput` events
- Numbers update while dragging, not just on release
- Smooth, immediate visual feedback
- Synchronized updates between sliders and text inputs

## Technical Changes

```javascript
// Before (v16):
<input type="range" onchange="updateFromPercentiles('ai'); updateCategories()">

// After (v17):
<input type="range" oninput="updateFromPercentiles('ai'); updateCategories()">
```

- Draggable essay display resize
- Minimize/maximize button
