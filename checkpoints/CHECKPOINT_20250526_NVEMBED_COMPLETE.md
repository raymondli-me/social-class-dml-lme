### Final Results Table
| Model | AI R² | SC R² | Gap | DML θ | p-value | Significant |
|-------|-------|-------|-----|-------|---------|-------------|
| **OpenAI** | 0.923 | 0.537 | 38.6% | 0.0527 | <0.001 | ✅ |
| **NV-Embed-v2** | 0.597 | 0.073 | 52.4% | 0.0016 | 0.0303 | ✅ |
| **MPNet** | 0.451 | 0.050 | 40.1% | 0.0018 | 0.107 | ❌ |

## 📊 Key Findings

### 1. OpenAI Remains King
- **Best at predicting AI ratings**: R² = 0.923 (92.3% variance explained)
- **Best at predicting actual SC**: R² = 0.537 (53.7% variance explained)
- **Strongest causal effect**: θ = 0.0527 (5.3% increase in AI rating per SC level)
- **Most statistically significant**: p < 0.001

### 2. NV-Embed-v2 Surprises
- **Expected**: #1 on MTEB benchmark → Best performance
- **Reality**: 2nd place, significantly behind OpenAI
- **Positive**: Still detects significant causal effect (p = 0.0303)
- **Issue**: Lower PCA retention (72.1% vs OpenAI's 95%)

### 3. MPNet Shows Limitations
- **Weakest performance** across all metrics
- **Cannot detect causal effect** (p = 0.107)
- **Free but limited** for causal inference tasks

## 🔧 Technical Journey

### Environment Challenges Overcome
1. **Dependency conflict**: NV-Embed requires transformers==4.42.4
2. **Solution**: Temporary environment modification
3. **GPU memory**: Successfully distributed across 4x RTX 3090
4. **Processing time**: 19.9 minutes for 9,513 essays

### Data Processing Pipeline
```
9,513 essays → NV-Embed-v2 (4,096 dims) → PCA (200 dims) → DML Analysis
                     ↓
            72.1% variance retained
                     ↓
         θ = 0.0016 (p = 0.0303) ✅
```

## 📈 Research Implications

### 1. Embedding Quality Matters for Causal Inference
- High-quality embeddings (OpenAI, NV-Embed) can detect subtle causal effects
- Lower-quality embeddings (MPNet) miss these effects entirely
- The difference between p = 0.03 and p = 0.11 is critical for research

### 2. Commercial vs Open Source Trade-offs
- **OpenAI**: Best quality, costs money ($1-2/run)
- **NV-Embed**: Good quality, free but complex setup
- **MPNet**: Moderate quality, easy setup but limited capability

### 3. The Bias Gap Persists
All models show ~35-50% gap between AI and SC prediction:
- AI ratings are consistently easier to predict than actual social class
- This bias exists regardless of embedding quality
- Suggests fundamental difference in how AI perceives vs reality
