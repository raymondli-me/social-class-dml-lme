**Date:** 2025-05-24 08:45:00  
**Session:** Complete vLLM Implementation and Problem Resolution

---

## Previous Checkpoint Summary

**From CHECKPOINT_20250523_170500_COMPLETE_STATUS.md:**
- Had completed simulation analyses on 526 essays 
- Achieved 0.987 correlation with 49 prompts, 0.990 with 50 prompts (simulated)
- Full 526-essay simulation only achieved 0.363 correlation (showing need for real vLLM)
- Data was properly blinded and scripts were ready
- **Status**: Ready for actual vLLM processing but hadn't started real model inference yet

---

## What We Accomplished This Session

### 1. **Attempted Initial vLLM Processing**
- Tried to run actual Qwen-32B model inference
- **Issue Encountered**: Missing Python development headers (python3-dev package)
- **Error**: `fatal error: Python.h: No such file or directory` during Triton compilation
- **Impact**: Model couldn't load initially due to compilation failures

### 2. **Implemented vLLM Error Suppression Workaround**
- **Solution**: Added `torch._dynamo.config.suppress_errors = True`
- **Effect**: Allows model to run in eager execution mode instead of compiled mode
- **Result**: ✅ Qwen-32B-AWQ successfully loads and runs across 2 GPUs
- **Performance**: Slightly slower than compiled mode but fully functional

### 3. **Discovered Response Parsing Issues**
- **Problem**: Initial runs showed ~99.5% parsing failure rate
- **Cause**: Model responses weren't in expected format (incomplete JSON, irrelevant text)
- **Examples**: `{"class_rating"` (truncated), "Based on the information provided" (meta-responses)
- **Decision**: Switched to saving raw responses without parsing

### 4. **Optimized Response Collection**
- **Changed**: Removed rating parsing during inference
- **Changed**: Increased max_tokens from 50 to 200 tokens
- **Changed**: Removed stop sequences to allow complete responses
- **Changed**: Disabled tqdm progress bars for nohup compatibility
- **Result**: Raw model outputs now captured completely for later analysis

### 5. **Added Human-Equivalent Prompt**
- **Implementation**: Replicated exact MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status prompt
- **Text**: "Imagine that this ladder pictures how society is set up..."
- **Key**: Added as FIRST prompt to match human rating conditions exactly
- **Format**: Adapted for LLM (no visual ladder, explicit 1-10 scale)

### 6. **Resolved CSV Formatting Issues**
- **Problem**: Prompt names showing as "nan" due to line breaks in CSV
- **Fixed**: Recreated CSV with single-line entries
- **Result**: Proper prompt names now display (e.g., "human_macarthur_ladder")

### 7. **Implemented Automatic Organization**
- **Added**: Timestamped output folders for each run
- **Structure**: `outputs/vllm_actual_suppressed/run_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/`
- **Benefit**: No mixing of results between runs, easy comparison

### 8. **Addressed Thermal Management**
- **Monitored**: GPU temperatures reaching 85°C during processing
- **Assessment**: Within safe limits but running hot
- **Recommendation**: Power limit reduction to 280W for sustainability
- **Decision**: User will handle power limits manually, keep processing settings

### 9. **Created Comprehensive Documentation**
- **Methods Document**: Complete technical specifications for paper
- **Includes**: Model details, hardware setup, prompting strategy, parameters
- **Purpose**: Ready-to-use methods section with all technical details

## Current Technical Configuration

### Model Setup
- **Model**: Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-AWQ
- **Hardware**: 2 × NVIDIA RTX 3090 (tensor parallelism)
- **Memory**: 70% GPU utilization (was 80%, could reduce for thermals)
- **Execution**: Eager mode with error suppression

### Processing Parameters
- **Batch Size**: 50 essays per batch
- **Temperature**: 0.1 (near-deterministic)
- **Max Tokens**: 200 (allows complete responses)
- **Stop Sequences**: None (complete generation)

### Data Processing
- **Essays**: 526 blinded essays (no demographic info)
- **Prompts**: 51 total (human MacArthur + 50 variations)
- **Total Inferences**: 26,826 (526 × 51)
- **Expected Runtime**: 2-3 hours

## Key Files Created/Modified

### Scripts
1. **run_vllm_with_suppression.py** - Main processing script with error suppression
2. **ladder_variations_51_human_first_fixed.csv** - Prompts with human equivalent first

### Documentation
1. **METHODS_VLLM_IMPLEMENTATION_20250524.md** - Complete technical specs
2. **QUICK_START_VLLM_MANUAL_EXECUTION.md** - Simple execution guide

### Data Structure
```

## Problems Solved

1. ✅ **vLLM Compilation Errors** → Error suppression workaround
2. ✅ **Response Parsing Failures** → Save raw outputs instead
3. ✅ **Truncated Responses** → Increased token limit, removed stop sequences
4. ✅ **Background Execution Issues** → Disabled problematic progress bars
5. ✅ **Human Prompt Integration** → Exact MacArthur scale replication
6. ✅ **CSV Formatting** → Fixed line break issues
7. ✅ **Result Organization** → Timestamped folders
8. ✅ **Temperature Concerns** → Monitoring and manual power management

## Ready to Execute

**Final Command:**
```bash
cd /media/raymondli/Crucial\ X9/2025_05_23_VLLM_IPAD_ANALYSES/2025_05_23_social_class_dml_lme/analysis_20250523_full_526
python3 scripts/run_vllm_with_suppression.py
```

**What This Will Do:**
1. Create timestamped output folder
2. Process human MacArthur ladder prompt first
3. Process 50 additional prompt variations
4. Save complete raw responses (no parsing)
5. Generate 26,826 total ratings
6. Complete in ~2-3 hours

**Thermal Management:**
- User will manually set power limits: `sudo nvidia-smi -i 0,1 -pl 280`
- Expected temperature reduction: 85°C → 75-80°C

## Next Steps After Completion

1. **Parse Raw Responses** - Extract numeric ratings from model outputs
2. **Calculate Correlations** - Compare with human ratings (target: 0.7-0.9)
3. **Process Binary Prompts** - Run 100 binary classification prompts
4. **DML-LME Analysis** - Causal effect estimation
5. **Paper Writing** - Methods section ready, results to follow
