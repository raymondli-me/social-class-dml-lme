# OpenAI Embedding Analysis - In Progress
**Started:** 2025-05-25 07:44 UTC  
**Status:** Generating embeddings via OpenAI API  

## Current Progress
- ✅ Script created with:
  - Black background for visualizations
  - Click-to-view full essay functionality (bottom right)
  - TreeSHAP instead of LIME
  - 200 PCA components
  
- ⏳ Currently running:
  - Generating embeddings for 9,513 essays
  - Using text-embedding-3-large model (3072 dimensions)
  - Processing ~96 batches of 100 essays each
  - Estimated time: 15-20 minutes

## Data Successfully Loaded
- Essays: 9,513 from ASC dataset
- Social class labels: Merged from `/media/raymondli/Crucial X9/asc_essays/essay_data/asc_9513_sc11.csv`
- Distribution matches expected (61% class 3)
- AI ratings: Averaged from 2 prompts per essay

## Next Steps (Automatic)
1. Complete embedding generation
2. PCA reduction to 200 components
3. DML analysis with Linear, Lasso, RF, XGBoost
4. 3D UMAP computation
5. Interactive visualization generation
6. SHAP analysis and plots

## Monitoring
Run this to check progress:
```bash
./monitor_openai_progress.sh
```

Or manually check:
```bash
# Check if embeddings are done
ls -la openai_checkpoints/openai_embeddings.npy

# Check if process is running
pgrep -f openai_embedding_analysis.py
```

## Expected Outputs
When complete, you'll have:
- `openai_visualizations/umap_actual_sc_openai.html` - Black background, click for full essay
- `openai_visualizations/umap_ai_rating_openai.html` - Same features
- `openai_visualizations/shap_analysis/*.png` - TreeSHAP visualizations
- `openai_checkpoints/dml_results_openai.pkl` - Model performance metrics

## Technical Notes
- API key is embedded in script and `.env.openai`
- Rate limiting implemented (0.1s delay between batches)
- Failover to individual requests if batch fails
- All paths are absolute for reliability
