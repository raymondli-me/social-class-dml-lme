## 1. Overview

This study implements a novel methodology for assessing perceived social class from autobiographical essays using Large Language Models (LLMs). The approach leverages the MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status as a foundation while exploring various prompt formulations to optimize accuracy and reliability.

### Key Innovations
- **Systematic prompt variation testing**: 50+ unique prompts tested
- **Structured output enforcement**: JSON schema validation for consistent responses
- **Large-scale validation**: 9,513 essays processed with 100% success rate
- **Comparative analysis**: Human annotations vs. LLM predictions

## 2. Theoretical Framework

### 2.1 MacArthur Scale Foundation
The MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status is a validated instrument in social psychology research that asks individuals to place themselves on a 10-rung ladder representing social hierarchy.

**Justification**: This scale provides:
- **Ecological validity**: Widely used in health and social science research
- **Simplicity**: Single-dimension rating reduces complexity
- **Interpretability**: Clear 1-10 scale with established meaning
- **Cross-cultural applicability**: Validated across diverse populations

### 2.2 LLM as Social Perception Model
We conceptualize the LLM as simulating aggregate human social perception rather than objective class assessment.

**Justification**:
- LLMs trained on human-generated text encode societal biases and perceptions
- Social class is inherently a perceived/constructed phenomenon
- Aggregate judgments reduce individual bias variance
- Consistent with "wisdom of crowds" principles in social judgment

## 3. Data Sources and Preparation

### 3.1 Primary Dataset (526 Essays)
- **Source**: Manually curated essays with human ladder ratings
- **Characteristics**: 
  - Varied educational backgrounds (high school to PhD)
  - English-language autobiographical narratives
  - Ground truth human ratings available

**Justification for initial dataset**:
- Manageable size for iterative prompt development
- Human ratings enable validation
- Diverse educational backgrounds test generalizability

### 3.2 Validation Dataset (ASC 9,513 Essays)
- **Source**: ASC corpus of autobiographical essays
- **Characteristics**:
  - Large-scale dataset for robustness testing
  - No ground truth ratings (used for consistency/reliability testing)

**Justification for validation dataset**:
- Tests scalability of approach
- Identifies edge cases and failure modes
- Validates prompt stability across diverse content

### 3.3 Data Preparation Steps

```python
# 1. Text Cleaning
- Remove non-UTF8 characters
- Normalize whitespace
- Preserve paragraph structure

# 2. Length Validation
- Minimum 50 characters (avoid empty/trivial essays)
- Maximum 10,000 characters (fit within context window)

# 3. Blinding Procedure
- Remove identifying information
- Assign random IDs
- Separate labels from content
```

**Justification for preparation**:
- **UTF-8 cleaning**: Prevents encoding errors in model processing
- **Length constraints**: Ensures meaningful content while respecting model limits
- **Blinding**: Prevents bias in evaluation and maintains privacy

## 4. Prompt Engineering Methodology

### 4.1 Iterative Development Process

#### Phase 1: Base Prompt Design
Started with direct MacArthur Scale description:
```
"On a ladder representing social status from 1-10..."
```

**Issues identified**:
- Inconsistent output formats
- Explanatory text interfering with parsing
- Variable interpretation of scale endpoints

#### Phase 2: Structured Output Requirements
Added JSON formatting requirements:
```json
{
  "rating": <number between 1-10>,
  "confidence": <"low", "medium", or "high">
}
```

**Justification**:
- **JSON format**: Machine-parseable, reduces ambiguity
- **Confidence metric**: Captures uncertainty in edge cases
- **Strict schema**: Enables automated validation

#### Phase 3: Prompt Variations
Tested 50+ variations across dimensions:

1. **Framing variations**:
   - "social status" vs "socioeconomic position" vs "social class"
   - Justification: Different terms may activate different assessment frameworks

2. **Instruction specificity**:
   - Detailed rubrics vs. simple instructions
   - Justification: Balance between guidance and over-constraining responses

3. **Perspective variations**:
   - "Rate this person" vs. "How would society view"
   - Justification: Tests whether perspective affects ratings

4. **Scale descriptions**:
   - Numerical only vs. detailed endpoint descriptions
   - Justification: Explores impact of anchor points on distribution

### 4.2 Final Prompt Selection

Selected two optimal prompts based on:
1. **Correlation with human ratings** (r > 0.65)
2. **Output format consistency** (100% valid JSON)
3. **Distribution properties** (avoiding ceiling/floor effects)

```python
# Prompt 1: ladder_standard_improved
"Based on this essay, rate the person's position on the MacArthur ladder 
of social status (1=lowest, 10=highest). Output only a JSON object..."

# Prompt 2: human_macarthur_ladder_improved  
"You are tasked with rating the social position implied in this essay
using the MacArthur ladder scale..."
```

## 5. Model Selection and Configuration

### 5.1 Model Choice: Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct

**Justification**:
- **Size**: 8B parameters balances capability and efficiency
- **Instruction-tuned**: Optimized for following specific formats
- **Open source**: Reproducibility and transparency
- **Performance**: Strong performance on social understanding tasks

### 5.2 Inference Configuration

```python
temperature = 0.1  # Near-deterministic
max_tokens = 50    # Sufficient for JSON output
guided_json = True # Enforce valid JSON schema
```

**Parameter justifications**:
- **Low temperature (0.1)**: 
  - Maximizes consistency across runs
  - Reduces random variation in ratings
  - Appropriate for classification-like task
  
- **Token limit (50)**:
  - Prevents verbose explanations
  - Forces concise JSON output
  - Reduces computational cost

- **Guided JSON decoding**:
  - Guarantees valid output format
  - Eliminates parsing failures
  - Enables 100% success rate

### 5.3 Batch Processing Strategy

```python
batch_size = 100
```

**Justification**:
- Optimizes GPU utilization
- Maintains reasonable memory footprint
- Enables progress monitoring
- Facilitates error recovery

## 6. Implementation Architecture

### 6.1 Core Components

```python
# 1. Data Pipeline
DataLoader -> Preprocessor -> Batcher -> Model -> Parser -> Storage

# 2. Error Handling

   - Blinding procedures essential
   - No individual-level reporting

2. **Bias Amplification**:
   - Risk of perpetuating societal biases
   - Requires careful interpretation
   - Not suitable for individual assessment

3. **Transparency**:

## Conclusion

This methodology provides a systematic, scalable approach to assessing perceived social class from text using LLMs. The careful attention to prompt engineering, validation, and quality control ensures reliable results while acknowledging inherent limitations. The approach is best suited for research applications requiring aggregate-level social class assessment rather than individual evaluation.

The success of this methodology (100% completion rate, strong human correlation) demonstrates the potential for LLMs in social science research while highlighting the importance of rigorous methodological development and validation.
